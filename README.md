### Functions

- User signup and login panel.
- Provide a search form to allow users to search for books by some search query.
- Display the search result in cards.
- Add the books what you favorite to the reading list, or remove the books from the reading list if you want.
- Display the fav books in the Reading list.
- Allow users to buy item by clicking enabled EYE icon.

<br />

### Development

- Use Next.js to integrate with server side with MongoDB
- Use the Google Books API to perform the search
- Store the fav books in the MongoDB with user info
- Implemented UI with Ant Design
- Hosted on Netlify
- Not add unit test and commits, because I have done them in the React version. So you can check React version for working progress with commits and issues.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
